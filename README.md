## 2. Project Overview

This project is a command-line application developed in a Unix/Linux environment to simulate and manage real-time hospital sensor data. The system consists of three Python data simulators and two primary Bash scripts: one for interactive log archival (`archive_logs.sh`) and one for data analysis (`analyze_logs.sh`). Our goal is to demonstrate proficiency in shell scripting, file system operations, and data manipulation.


One of the main challenges was coordinating our work on GitHub, ensuring we didn't have merge conflicts. We learned the importance of frequent commits and using branches for different features.
